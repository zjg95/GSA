### Group Number 1
### Group Members: 
- Andrew Capindo
- David Acker
- Zachary Goodman

### Application Name:
TBA, Development name: GSA

### Application Type:
consumer/utility

### General Description:
An application that allows the user to create and alter time sheets for their employees. Simple drag and drop of time slots, similar to that of the Calendar App when creating events. Will also feature an option to create a schedule automatically given shift times, employee availability, and employee profiles. Auto scheduling will be able to schedule employees based on the timeslots requirements and to other criteria assigned by employer.

### Feature List:
- Creating timeslot for employee: Allows for employer to create a time slot for an employee and assign that employee a shift.
- Send timesheet to employees: Allows for employer to send the shift times for that week of that employee via email or text.
- Auto Scheduling: Allows for employer to create the shifts and then have the app automatically schedule the employees.
- Shift Saving: Allows for employer to create a weekly shift schedule that can be saved and re-used.
- Employee Profiles: Allows for employer to create employee profiles which include contact info, availability, expertise, position.
- Export to PDF or Readable File: After finalizing schedule employer should be able to make a printable version of the schedule.
- Save App State: On relaunch of app previous data will be loaded in app. Such as employee information.
- Shift specifications: Each shift will require a type of employee be working in the shift.

### Target Audience:
Our target audience would be small business owners or managers of businesses. They would be interested in it as it allows the employer to easily create a timesheet for their employees. It will make a cheap alternative for making schedules as it will save time. 

### Development Plan:
#### Alpha:
Get a working backend with a barebone interface. This means that there should be an ability to schedule employees manually. Create employee barebone employee profiles.

#### Beta:
Auto scheduling should be mostly done, with most cases taken care of. Corner cases may be looked over. Be able to access old and future schedules. Improve UI.

#### Final:
Improve UI to a releasable state. Be able to send out schedules either electronically or in a printable version. Auto scheduling should be 100% working.
