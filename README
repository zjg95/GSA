- completely rebuilt the Shift Details Veiw. It was once an ugly view with data plopped on the screen in a bad order. Now it's using a table view and looks WAY cleaner.
- added view constraints to ensure that views scale well across all devices. Some views had too much content to scale. This is a fundamental design problem that needs to be rethought.
- used NSUserDefaults to save the last view that the user accessed in the schedule view
- implemented back-end changes to the construction of new schedules (copying employee data into a new structure)
- fixed various compile warnings and numerous bugs/errors
